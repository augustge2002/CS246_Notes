# Encapsulation and Introduction to Design Patterns



# 5.1 Invariants and Encapsulation (Feb 15)

## Invariants

Considet the linked list class:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node(int data, Node *next) : data{data}, next{next} {}
    ~Node() { delete next; }
};

int main() {
    Node n1{1, new Node{2, nullptr}};
    Node n2{3, nullptr};
    Node n3{4, &n2};
}	// what happen here?
```

There is a problem with the destructor, what happens when these objects go out of scope?

When these objects go out of scope, they are destroyed by their destructors. All n1, n2, and n3 are stack-allocated, so all three have their destructors run. When n1's dtor runs it reclaims the rest of the list, BUT when n3's dtor runs it attempts to delete the memory at the address of n2. That's on the stack, not the heap.

This is undefined behaviour, quite possible the program will crash. However, if we do not delete next, we will be leaking memory.

So the class `Node` replies on an assumptiong for its proper operation: that `next` is either `nullptr` or is a valid pointer to the heap (a ptr to a valid heap allocated Node).

*We need to make a rule*.

An **invariant** is a statement that must hold true for all cases. (upon which Node relies) But with the way that `class Node` is implemented, we can't guarantee this invariant will hold.

So, *an invariant is a statement that must hold true otherwise our program will not function correctly*.



How do we make sure the statement is always true?



Consider another example:

An invariant for a <u>stack</u> is that the last item pushed is the first item popped, but we cannot guarantee this invariant if the client can rearrange the underlying data within the stack.

Violating the invariant may not result in a compiling or execution error, if the client rearranges items in the stack, the stack will still return an item when `pop()` is called. However, the returned item may not be what the client was expecting. This can lead to *logical errors* (*bugs*). Logical errors are usually very difficult to debug since the program can still execute and not display any error, it may simply generate the wrong results.



We introduce **encapsulation** to enforce invariants and avoid logical errors.

*Encapsulation is one of the benefits of using object-oriented programming*.





## Encapsulation

To enforce this invariant, we must make sure the client can't break it. We do so by introducing the idea of **encapasulation**. It is so named because we want clients to treat our object as *black boxes* or *capsules* that provide abstractions in which implementation details are hidden away, and such clients can only manipulate them in our provided methods. By doing so, we regain some control over our objects and thus our life!

We implement encapsulation by setting the **access modifier** (or **visibility**) for each one of the members (fields or methods) of a class:

- **private** class members can only be accessed from within the objecy (i.e., using the implicit `this` pointer of the object's methods). Any other objects (of another type) or funciton cannot direcly access private member of an object. Private fields cannot be read or modified from outside of the object's methods, and private methods cannot be called from outside of the object's methods.
- **public** class members can be accedd from anywhere. Public fields can be read and modified from outside the object and public methods can be called from outside of the object.



Example:

```cpp
Struct Vec {
    Vec(int a, int b); // by default, members are **public**, accessible outside of the class
    private:		// what follows is private, which cannot be accessed outside of struct Vec.
    	int x, y;	// client can no longer directly access this field
    public:			// what follows is public, acccessible to all
    	Vec operator+(const Vec &other) const;
};

int main() {
    Vec v{1, 3};
    v.x = s;	// Error! x is private
    cout << v.x << endl; // still Error! x is private!
}
```

```cpp
Vec Vec::operator+(const Vec &other) const {
        return {x + other.x, y + other.y}; // fine, we're inside a Vec method!
}
```

We can say that *we encapsulated the implementation details of Vec*, so the client cannot access the internal state of the object directly.

Note, what by default all member of structs are publice, you must specify a section as private if you want private members.

In general, we want fields to be private, only some methods should be public, ... so it would be better if the default visibility is private.

We can achieve exactly that by switching from the `struct` keyword to the `class` keyword.





## The `class` Keyword

The **only** difference between `class` and `struct` is their default visibility: class-private, struct-public

```cpp
class Vec {
    int x, y;	// these are private by default
    public:
    	Vec(int x, int y);
    	Vec operator+(const Vec &other);
};
```

Class is the same as writing

```cpp
struct Vec {
    Vec(int x, int y);
    private:
    	int x, y;
    public:
    	Vec operator+(const Vec &other) const;
    
};
```





Now let's fix our linked list with encapsulation. The key is to create a *wrapper class <u>list</u>* that has the exclusive rights to modifying the underlying Node objects.

*Invariant*: next should be either nullptr or a valid pointer to a heap-allocated Node, which will be freed in the Node's destructor.

We need to hide(encapsulate) the implementation details of the nodes from the clients. Allocate the Node by the list implementation, which we will guarantee that they will always be allocated in the heap.



list.h

```cpp
class List {
    Struct Node; // private nested class, only accessible within list
    Node *head = nullptr;	// initialize the empty list
  public:
    void addToFront(int n);	// adds an element to the front of the list
    int ith(int i);	// retrieves the ith element of the list
    ~List();		// dtor
};
```



list.cc

```cpp
// now need the details of class Node
struct List::Node {		// Node within the List class
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node (int data, Node *next) : data{data}, next{next} {}
    ~Node() { delete next; }
};

// List destructor:
List::~List() { delete head; }	// delete head ptr, and all other node will be deleted throught the node dtor

void List::addToFront(int n) {
    head = new Node{n, head};	// the next ptr of new head will be the old head
}
int List::ith(int i) {
    Node *cur = head;
    for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j; cur = cur->next);	// compute cur->next on the for loop
    return cur->data;
}
```

Note that the Node is a nested class of List, so clients will never be able to use it directly. The members of the class Node don't need to be pribate as the class itself is already limited to exist within the List.

Clients can never create nodes directly, they can only create initially empty lists (using list's default constructor) and add int elements using addToFront.

Now that we've done all this, the client can't touch the `Node &s` in our list, so we've guaranteed that they will be either the nullptr or a ptr to a valid heap allocated Node. Great!



Best practise: make members private by default and only make public those methods that need to be called from outside of the object. It is usally perferable to use `class` and then only change the necessary methods to public visibility.

Remember to document the invariant using comments in your implementation!



## Accessor and Mutator Methods (Feb 17)

When you use encapsulation, the clients cannot read or modify the values of the object's fields because they are all private. If you need to allow clients to read or modify those values from outside of the object, you can create **accessor** and **mutator** methods.

Also known as **Getter** and **Setter**.



```cpp
Class Vec {
    int x, y;   
  public:
    int getX() const { return x; }	// accessor
    // Node: here we return an int, which is just a copy of the value of x, thus we won't change x
    int getY() const { return y; }
    
    void setX(int n) { x = n; } // mutator, if we want, there can be invariant checks in here
    void setY(int n) { y = n; }
    	
};
```

Naming convention:
- get*Field*
- set*Field*
- where *Field* is the actual field name
- you can replace `get` with `is` for boolean fields (i.e. is*Field*)

Also by convention: accessor methods should *not* modify any state, only read and return value of a field. Therefore, accessor methods should generally be declared as `const`.


```cpp
Example of invariant check:
void setY(int n) {
    if (n == 69) return;	// if n is mutating the invariant, don't let it
    y = n;
}
```

Only create accessor methods for fields whose value of if interest to the clients, no need to create accessors for fields that store internal state inside the object. Only create mutator methods for fields whose value should be directly updated by clients, there is no need to create mutators for any internal state that should only be manipulated inside the object.



The stack data structure should not have any getters and setters to protect its internal data structure, only use push() and pop() methods.

```cpp
class Stack {
    int *elements;	// private field with internal state that is not directly visible to the clients
    int numElements; // private field with internal state that is not directly visible to the clients
  public:
    Stack(); // constructor
    ~Stack(); // destructor
    void push(int); // adds an elementt into stack (modifies elements and numElements)
    int pop(); // removes and returns an element from stack (modifies elements and numElements)
};
```





It is a good application of encapsulation to enfore the invariants and aboid logical errors:

```cpp
// Invariant: all grades are between 0 and 100
class Student {
    
    int assns, mt, final;
    int enforceGradeValue(int g) const {	// private method because it doesn't need to be called by clients
    	if (g < 0) return 0;
        if (g > 100) return 100;
        return g;
    }
    
  public:
    int getAssns() const { return assns; }
    int setAssns(int g) { assns = enforceGradeValue(g); }
    int getMt() const { return mt; }
    int setMt(int g) { assns = enforceGradeValue(g); }
    int getFinal() const { return final; }
    void setFinal(int g) { final = enforceGradeValue(g); }
    
};
```

The method `enforceGradeValue` is private because it is a good practise to hide the internal implementation details and only disply to the client what they need to know to use the class. This makes the public interface smaller and easier for client to understand.

Hiding unnecessary details from the client is also part of the encapsulation, even if they would not break an invariant if exposed.



## Friends!

Sometimes, it may be useful to give some class privileged access to another class's private members.

Recall our linked list:

```cpp
// lish.h
Class List { // default visibility private cuz of Class keyword
    struct Node; // private nested Class, only accessible within List
    Node &head;
  	public:
    	void addToFront(int n);
    	int ith(int i);
    	~List();
};
```



Since only the class List can manipulate Node Objects, we can guarantee our invariant that each next ptr points at either nullptr or a valid heap-allocated Node.

Now, the **problem** is, the client can't tranverse the list from Node to Node as we would with a linked list.

Repeatedly calling **i**th to access all of the list items would cause **O(n^2^)** time! Not efficient!

One possible solutions is to make Node a public nested class so that clients can retrieve nodes and follow the pointer to the next node in the list, but make the Node constructor private, so the clients can never create nodes. BUT if the constructor is private, List won't be able to create Nodes either.



We solve this by giving class List privileged access to Node by making it a **friend**.

Solution: Power of friendship! :rainbow: (Rob insists us to draw this rainbow for "friendship")

```cpp
class List {
  public:
    class Node {	// public nested class
        int data;
        Node *next;
        Node(int data, Node *next); // constructor is now private!
   	  public:
        ~Node();
        int getData() const;
        Node *getNext() const;
        friend class List; // List has access to all members of Node
    }
  private:
    Noed *head = nullptr;	// private internal state
  public:
    void addToFront(int n); 	// adds an element to the front of the list
    int ith(int i) const;		// retrieves the element in the ith position of the list
    Node *getNodeAt(int i) const;	// retrieves the Node in the ith position of the list
    ~List();
};
```



Now, clients can use List's method getNodeAt to retrieve a pointer to the Node in any position on the list. Node's getData method can be used to retrieve the value of the element and getNext can be used to traverse to the next node.

Note the the clients cannot directly access the internal state of Node because the fields are private, but the class List can! List can access the private fields of Node and create new Node (call Node's private constructor) because we declared List as a friend class of Node.



**NOTE**: in general, you should give your classes as *few* friends as possible. Friendships *weaken* encapsulation, and thus should be used only if really necessary.



We also partially broke encapsulation because we exposed the implementation details of Nodes to clients. Ideally, clients should be able to traverse a list in the most efficient way possible without knowing what is the internal structure of the list (i.e., if it uses an internal array, a linked list, a tree, etc. should not matter to clients).

We do this using the **Iterator Design Pattern**.



### Friend Functions

Example: the Vec alss, the x and y fields are private and have no accessor methods:

```cpp
class Vec {
    int x, y;
};
```



What if we want to implement  `operator<<` and `operator>>` to print the values of x and y? We need access to x and y, and `operator<<` and `operator>>` cannot be a member function.

If we add getter and setters just for these functions, everyone can access them, but we don't necessarily want that ---- Yet again, friendship! :rainbow: We can make `operator<<` a **friend function**.



```cpp
// vec.h
class Vec {
    int x, y;
    friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Vec &v);
    // as soon as we say it is a friend, it is no longer a member function
};

// vec.cc
std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &out, const Vec &v) {
    return out << v.x << ' ' << v.y;
}
```



Friend declaration doesn't matter if you declare it in the public or private section. Usually you put friends in the end of the class, by convention.

Friends functions also weaken encapsulation and should be used only if *really* necessary.





# 5.2 Design Patterns and Iterators



## Design Patterns Introduction

Certain programming senarios or problems are common and arise often, traversing the linked list is one such problem. We as programmers keep track of good solutions to these problems so we can reuse them.



This is the essence of **design patterns**. If you have <u>this</u> situation, then <u>this</u> programming solution (method) <u>may</u> solve it.

A **design** pattern is a codified solution to a common software problem. It specifically deals with a problem in object oriented software development, and thus focuses on the involved classes and their relationships.

A design pattern has 4 key elements:

1. a memorable name that describes the problem or solution
2. a description of the problem to solve
3. the general form of the solution, and
4. the consequences (results and trade-offs) of using the pattern



The guiding principle behing all of the design patterns is: encapsulate change on design decisions. i.e. program to the *interface*, not the *implementation*. The class relationships thus rely heavily upon abstract base classes.



## Iterator

The problem of encapsulated linked list: we can't traverse the list from node to node, repeatedly calling `ith` to access all of the list items would cost O(n^2^) time, but we can't expose the nodes or we lose encapsulation.



Solution: how do I allow client to iterate my data in a hidden structure without revealing the structure.

**Iterator Problem**: we create a class that manages access to Nodes (some access, not all).

This iterator class is effectively an *abstraction* of a pointer. (It's going to behave like a ptr, you can use it as a ptr, but not as always, you can't change anything about this ptr). This will let us walk through the list, without exposing actual pointers.



**General format** of an iterator:

```cpp
class MyclassIterator {
    // some private field to keep track of where the iterator is currently pointing to
    explicit MyClassIterator (/* a parameter to initialize it */); // private constructor
  public:
    MyClass &operator*(); // access the item the iterator is currently pointing to (return type can be different if needed)
    MyClassIterator &operator++(); // advances the iterator to the next item and returns the iterator
    bool operator==(const MyClassIterator &other) const; // returns true if both Iterators are equal (point to the same item)
    bool operator!=(const MyClassIterator &other) const; //returns true if both Iterators are different (do not point to the same item)
    
};
```



Linked List with an Iterator:

```cpp
Class List {
    struct Node;
    Node &head;
    public:	// add a public nested class, class Iterator
    	Class Iterator { // List::Iterator
            Node &p;
            public:
            	explicit Iterator(Node &p) : p{p} {}
            	// we want to access the data of the ptr, the dereference operator
            	int &operator*() { return p->data; }
            	// overload the prefix operator ++, returns the thing that is incremented
            	Iterator &operator++() { // prefer the prefix operator in loops (i.e. ++i)
                    p = p->next;
                    return *this;
                }
            	// to overload the postfix operator:
            	// operator++(int)()
            	bool operator==(const Iterator &other) const  {
                    // an Iterator is equal to another if their pointers are equal
                    return p == other.p;
                }
            	bool operator!=(const Iterator &other) const {
                    // the reverse of the equals operator
                    return !(*this == other);	// use the above defined ==
				}
        }; // end of List::Iterator
    
    	// we want to know the end iterator (a token that signals we are done)
    	Iterator end() { return Iterator{nullptr}; }	// linked list ends with a nullptr
    	// we also need to know what's the start
    	Iterator begin() { return Iterator{head}; }
    	// .. Any other list functions (addToFront, ith, etc.)
    
}
```

Now, the client can walk our list in O(n) (linear time!)

```cpp
int main() {
    List lst;
    lst.addToFront(1);
    lst.addToFront(2);
    lst.addToFront(3);
    // 3->2->1
    for (List::Iterator it = lst.begin(); it != lst.end(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << endl; // prints 3 2 1
    }
}
```



Writing out `List::Iterator` is a mouthful.. Well, `it` is being assigned to the return value of a function.

- the compiler *knows* what type that function returns, then we should be able to ask the compiler to figure out the type for us. We can do so with the keyword `auto`, by taking advantage of **automatic type deduction**.

- A definition like `auto x = y;` defines x to have the same type as y. The main advantage is that we don't need to write down the exact type of x, which may be complex.

- ```cpp
  for (auto it = lst.begin(); lt != lst.end(); ++it)
  ```

- use auto sparingly, it could make code unreadable as the reader may not know the types. But, the iterator pattern is so pervasive to c++ it's quite clear what we mean here.

- It's **so pervasive** in C++ that there's a special form of for loops for using iterators: **Range-based for loops**

```cpp
for (auto n : lst) {	// Range based for loop, works on any container that implements the iterator pattern!
    cout << n << endl;
} // Note: n is already the value of derefering the iterator, auto is an int here
```

n is an `int`, we are declaring an `int` variable `n`, so:

```cpp
for (auto n : lst) {
    n = n + 1;	// list doesn't change, only mutating variable n, which is a copy of each element in the list
}
```

If we want to mutate the elements in list, we declare n as a int reference

```cpp
for (auto &n : lst) {
    ++n; 	// now mutates the list, n refers to the same thing as the reference returned by the deference iterator
}
```

Range based for-loops are available for any type T with the following properties (T is our container type)

- T must provide `begin()` and `end()` methods that take no parameters and return some type I (I is our iterator type)
- Type I must define inequality `operator!=` between two type Is, increment prefix operator `++`, and unary operator `*`
- any classes T and I that have the above behaviour mean you can write a range based for loop over objects of type T.



```cpp
Class IntArray {
    int *theArray;
    int size;
    int capacity;
    public:
    	int *begin() { return theArray; }
    	int *end() { return theArray + size; } // ptr arithematic here
};
// an int* type has its operator!=, operator++, operator* already defined.
```



A minimal implementation of the Iterator design pattern requires at least five operators

- `begin ` in the base class
- `end` in the base class
- `operator++` in the Iterator class
- `operator*` in the Iterator class
- `operator!=` in the Iterator class




### Friend for Iterator

One critique of the Iterator solution is, consider:

```cpp
// main.cc
auto it = List::Iterator(nullptr);
```

This violates encapsulation - the client should only create iterators begin and and.

We could make the ctor private, but then List can't construct iterators either, so we can't implement begin and end.



We give List priviliged access to class iterator by declaring it a a friend.

```cpp
Class List {
    public:
    	Class Iterator {
            Node *p;
            explicit Iterator(Node &p) : p{p} {}		// private constructor
        	pubilc:
            friend Class List; // :), list can access all member of Iterator
        };
};
```

Now, List can access private members of Class Iterator, so, begin and end can now construct iterators, but the clients can't. Iterators cannot access private members of a list! Good programming in C++: Have as few friends as possible!

But be careful: Friends weaken encapsulation.
