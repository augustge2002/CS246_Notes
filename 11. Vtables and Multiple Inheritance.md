# 11. Vtables and Multiple Inheritance



## How Virtual Methods Work? (March 31)



```cpp
struct A { virtual void hello() { cout << "I'm an A"; } };

struct B : public A { void hello() override { cout << "I'm a B"; } };

int main() {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    A *ap;
    if (x < 0) ap = new A;
    else ap = new B;
}

// By what magic does the compiler know what to do for ap->hello() ?
```



When `ap->hello()` is called, then compiler observes this is a virtual method. Instead of generating code to jump to `A::hello()` based on the fact that `ap` is an A pointer, the compiler instead does **virtual dispatch**.

How does it achieve virtual dispatch? 

- <u>How</u> is not dictated  by the C++ standard
- <u>What</u> virtual must be is

But, most compilers will do the following:

Consider:

```cpp
class Vec {
	int x, y;
  public:
    int doSomething() {...}
};

class Vec2 {
    int x, y;
  public:
    virtual int doSomething() {...}
};

// do they look the same in memory?
Vec v{1, 2};
Vec2 w{1, 2};

// no, they have different sizes:
cout << sizeof(v) << " " << sizeof(w) << endl;
// prints 8 and 16, why?
```

Note: 8 is space for ints for no space allocated for doSomething() method (in Vec).

Compiler turns methods into ordinary functions that stores them separately from objects.





## Virtual Table (April 5)

Recall the book example: If isHeavy() is virtual, choice of which version to run is based on the type of the actual object - which the compiler can't know in advance.

How is the correct version of isHeavy() been chosen at runtime by the compiler?

For each class with virtual methods, the compiler creates a *table of function pointers* (the **vtable**), and instances of that class have an extra pointer (the vptr or virtual funvction table ptr) that point to the class's vtable.

![11-1](E:\UW Stuff\CS246\Course Notes\images\11-1.png)

Example:

```cpp
class C {
    int x, y;
    virtual void f();
    virtual void g();
    void h();
    virtual ~C();
}
```

Calling a ***non-virtual*** method:

- compiler makes space on the stack for locals/parameters
- jumps to the location in code where that function exists

Calling a ***virtual*** method on a base class ptr/reference:

- follows the vptr to the vtable
- fetches ptr to the function from the location in code
- makes room on stack and jumps to location in code as specified by that function pointer (calls the function)

This happens at runtime. Therefore, virtual function calls incur a small overhead cost.

Also, declaring at least one virtual method adds a vptr to the object, therefore classes without virtual methods produces small objects than if some functions were virtual.



A class can inherit from more than one class:

```cpp
struct A {
    int a;
};

struct B {
    int b;
};

class C : public A, public B {
    void f() {
        cout << a << " " << b << endl;
    }
};
```



Suppose B and C both inherit from A, suppose also that class D inherit from B and C (filled diamond shaped relationship). Further suppose A has field `int a;`. Then consider:

```cpp
D dobj;
dobj.a; // which a is this? B's a or C's a?
```

The access to this field is ambiguous! D has two `a` fields, one from B and one from C. We need to specify

```cpp
dobj.B::a;
// or
dobj.C::a;
```

But, if this is coming from class A, do we really want two copies?
