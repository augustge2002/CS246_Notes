## How Virtual Methods Work? (March 31)

How exactly is the correct `virtual` method chosen dynamically at run-time?

```cpp
struct A { virtual void hello() { cout << "I'm an A"; } };

struct B : public A { void hello() override { cout << "I'm a B"; } };

int main() {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    A *ap;
    if (x < 0) ap = new A;
    else ap = new B;
}

// By what magic does the compiler know what to do for ap->hello() ?
```



When `ap->hello()` is called, then compiler observes this is a virtual method. Instead of generating code to jump to `A::hello()` based on the fact that `ap` is an A pointer, the compiler instead does **virtual dispatch**.

How does it achieve virtual dispatch? 

- <u>How</u> is not dictated  by the C++ standard
- <u>What</u> virtual must be is

But, most compilers will do the following:

Consider, how an object is laid out in memory:

```cpp
class Vec {
	int x, y;
  public:
    int doSomething() {...}
};

class Vec2 {
    int x, y;
  public:
    virtual int doSomething() {...}
};

// do they look the same in memory?
Vec v{1, 2};
Vec2 w{1, 2};

// no, they have different sizes:
cout << sizeof(v) << " " << sizeof(w) << endl;
// prints 8 and 16, why?
```

Note: 8 is space for ints for no space allocated for doSomething() method (in Vec).



So how does the operating system know where to find the `doSomething()` function? 

Well, it has an address in memory, and any call to the function is replaced by a transfer to that memory location.

The compiler turns methods into ordinary functions that stores them separately from objects.



## VTable (April 5)

Recall the book example: If isHeavy() is virtual, choice of which version to run is based on the type of the actual object - which the compiler can't know in advance.

How is the correct version of isHeavy() been chosen at runtime by the compiler?

For each class with virtual methods, the compiler creates a *table of function pointers* (the **vtable**), and instances of that class have an extra pointer (the vptr or virtual function table ptr) that point to the class's vtable.

Every instance of the class now contains a virtual pointer to the vtable.



![11-1](https://github.com/kila097/CS246_Notes/blob/main/images/11-1.png)

Example:

```cpp
class C {
    int x, y;
    virtual void f();
    virtual void g();
    void h();
    virtual ~C();
}
```

Each of the objects c and d, have a field for the vptr, and the two data fields x and y. Each vptr points to the vtable (virtual table) for the class. The vtable contains an entry for each virtual method, that points to the location of the method code in memory.

 

Revisit our Book and Text example:

![11-3](https://github.com/kila097/CS246_Notes/blob/main/images/11-3.png)

Each object has the data fields appropriate to its type (a Book has title, author, and numPages, while a Text has title, author, numPages, and topic), and the **vptr**. The vptr for a Book points to the Book vtable, while the vptr of the Text points to the Text vtable. Each of the vtables has an entry for the virtual isHeavy method, and they point to the different locations where each class implementation is stored in memory.

Consider:

```cpp
Book *bptr = new Text{...};
...
cout << bptr->isHeavy() << endl;
```

In order to call the correct virtual method for whatever bptr is pointing to, we need to:

1. Follow the object's vptr to the vtable
2. Fetch the address for the isHeavy method for that class
3. Go to the address for that isHeavy method
4. Execute the method code at that address





Calling a ***non-virtual*** method:

- compiler makes space on the stack for locals/parameters
- jumps to the location in code where that function exists

Calling a ***virtual*** method on a base class ptr/reference:

- follows the vptr to the vtable
- fetches ptr to the function from the location in code
- makes room on stack and jumps to location in code as specified by that function pointer (calls the function)

This happens at runtime. Therefore, virtual function calls incur a small overhead cost (small performance penalty).

Also, declaring at least one virtual method adds a vptr to the object, therefore classes without virtual methods produces smaller objects than if some functions were virtual.



How is the information actually laid out in memory? Well, that depends upon the compiler implementation.

Consider:

```cpp
class A {
  public:
    int a, c;
    virtual void f();
}

class B : public A {
  public:
    int b, d;
}
```

In g++, the vptr is the first data field in the object, then the data fields `a` and `c` follow, in that order, for a type A object. For a type B object, which inherits from A, the vptr is followed by A's data fields, then B's data fields.

Structurally, it looks like this:

![11-4](https://github.com/kila097/CS246_Notes/blob/main/images/11-4.png)

The vptr pointers are 8-byte long in C++, they take up 2 integers worth of information.





## Multiple Inheritance (April 5)

A class can inherit from more than one class. (In java, you can only inherit from one class)



```cpp
struct A {
    int a;
};

struct B {
    int b;
};

class C : public A, public B {
    void f() {
        cout << a << " " << b << endl;
    }
};
```







Suppose B and C both inherit from A, suppose also that class D inherit from B and C.

![11-2](https://github.com/kila097/CS246_Notes/blob/main/images/11-2.png)

(the deadly diamond, or the diamond of death, or the deadly diamond of death) due to the shape of the inheritance hierarchy

Further suppose A has field `int a;`. Then consider:

```cpp
D dobj;
dobj.a; // which a is this? B's a or C's a?
```

The access to this field is ambiguous! D has two `a` fields, one from B and one from C. We need to specify by using the scope resolution operator `::` to pick the version we want to access:

```cpp
dobj.B::a;
// or
dobj.C::a;
```

However, we have two copies of the data fields for class A since the default behaviour of the compiler is to treat them as being two different things.

But, if this is coming from class A, do we really want two copies?

**The solution**: make class A a **virtual base class** and employ **virtual inheritance** to specify classes B and C. This tells the compiler that there will be only one instance of the superclass object in memory for the concrete subobject.

```cpp
class B : virtual public A {...};
class C : virtual public C {...};
```

If we do that, D will have only one copy of `a`, great!

```cpp
A *a = new D; // this points to a D
// we have to do dynamic casting, where does the A field go?
```



The memory layout for object type D roughly looks like:

![11-6](https://github.com/kila097/CS246_Notes/blob/main/images/11-6.png)





The real life example in C++ I/O library, `basic_ostream` virtually inherits from `basic_ios`, and `ostream` inherits from `basic_ostream`.
