# 10. Advanced C++



## Pimpl Idiom (March 24)

Consider the class for an XWindowing (windowing system)

```cpp
// xwindow.h
class XWindow {
    Display *d;
    Window w;
    int s;
    GC gc;
    unsigned long colours[10];
 public:
    ...
};
```



What if we need to add or change a private member? (i.e., changing the heading file) All clients must recompile. Seems unnecessary.

Would be better to hide these details away. The solution is to used the **Pimpl idiom** (**pointer to implementation**).

Since it is an **idiom**, it is a programming technique, not a design pattern.

**Motivation**: Our header file have to show the private data fields and methods, accesible to the clients. They are part of the structure, and take up space. Also, any time we change the implementation details, even of the private information and/or methods, the client *has* to recompile their code that includes the header file.

In other words, it is not just sufficient to link in the new .o file, we need to recompile everything and linking again.



Lets create a second class XWindowImpl, we can replace all of the private data fields with a pointer to a class that we forward-declare in our header file.

Since we are no longer declaring data fields whose types are defined in the X11 library, we can also move that particular include statement to our implementation file.

The client never sees the contents of the implementation file, they just receives the header file and the .o file, they won't know how we actually implemented things.

Every reference to the original data fields in the implementation file now need to *go through the pointer* to the struct to access the fields declared there:

```cpp
// XWindowImpl.h

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
// we define XWindowImpl as a struct and take advantage of public accessibility of the data fields.
struct XWindowImpl {
    Display *d;
    Window w;
    int s;
    GC gc;
    unsigned long colours[10];
};

// xwindow.h
// here we redefine XWindowImpl as a class
class XWindowImpl;
class XWindow {
    XWindow Impl *pImpl;	// pointer to our implementation class
  public:
    // no change
};
```

Note: it is perfectly legal in C++ to *redefine a class as a struct*, and vice versa in the implementation file.

```cpp
// xwindow.cc
#include "window.h"
#include "XWindowImpl.h"

XWindow::XWindow(...) : pimpl{new XWindowImpl} {
    // constructor
    ...
   	pImpl->d = XOpenDisplay(nullptr);
    ...
}

XWindow::~XWindow() {
    XFreeGC(pImpl->d, pImpl->gc);
    XCloseDisplay(pImpl->d);
    delete pImpl;
}
```

In other methods, replace the fields d, w, s, ... with `pImpl->d`, `pImpl->w`, `pImpl->s`,...

If you confine all private fields within XWindowImpl, then adding/changing fields doesn't change the size of XWindow, and clients won't need to recompile only XWindow (and XWindowImpl) do. (i.e., changing fields in the XWindowImpl's interface (.h) won't need to recompile client file)





Alternate example: [from cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl)

Pimpl is a C++ programming technique that removes implementation details of a class from its object representation by placing them in a separate class, accessed through an opaque pointer:

```cpp
// widget.h (interface)

class widget {
    struct impl;	// foward declaration of the implementation class
    std::experimental::propagate_const<std::unique_ptr<impl>> pImpl;
    // const-forwarding pointer wrapping, unique-ownership opaque pointer to the foward-declared implementation class
};

// widget.cc (implementation)
struct widget::impl {
    // implementation details
};
```

This technique reduce compile-time dependencies.

Because private data members of a class participate in its object representation, affecting size and layout, and because private member function of a class participate in overload resolution, any change to those implementation details requires recompilation of all users of the class (including header files).

*pImpl* removes this compilation dependency, changes to those implementation (of members) **do not** cause recompilation.

## Measures of Design Quality

**Coupling** 耦合度（Coupling）是一个类与其他类关联、知道其他类的信息或者依赖其他类的强弱程度的度量。

- How much distinct program modules depend on each other
- *low coupling*
  - (low) modules communicate via calls with basic parameters and results
  - modules pass arrays/structs back and forth
  - modules accept each other's control flow
  - modules share global data
  - (high) modules have access to each other's data directly (i.e. friend)
- *high coupling*
  - Higher coupling means changes to one modules require greater changes to others. Makes it harder to reuse individual modules.



**Cohesion** 聚合度（Cohesion）是对一个类中的各个职责之间相关程度和集中程度的度量。

- How closely elements of a module are related to each other
- *low cohesion*
  - (low) arbitrary grouping of relatively unrelated elements (`<utility>`)
  - elements share some common theme, otherwise unrelated. Perhaps they share some base code (`<algorithm>`)
  - elements manipulate state over the lifetime of an object or resource (e.g., opening, reading, closing files)
  - elements pass data to each other to achieve work
  - (high) elements cooperate to perform exactly one task (`<vector>`)
- *high cohesion*
  - low cohesion means poorly organized code, and harder to understand and maintain



Goal:

**Low coupling and High cohesion!!**

If we apply the goal of low coupling and high cohesion consistently in our designs, then we're effectively applying the design principle called the **single responsibility principle (SPR)**. All of the design patterns that we have seen decoupled classes by introducing abstract base classes, which let the client "**program to the interface**, and not the the implementation".



Your primary goal of classes should not be printing/displaying things

Example: ChessBoard

```cpp
class ChessBoard {
    ...
    cout << "Your move!" << endl;
    cin >> c; // read move
};

// this is questionable design, it limits code reuse.
```

What if I want to communicate via a different output stream?

Could instead construct the object with the stream I want...better, but what if I don't want streams at all, what if I want graphics?



Your chess board should be a chessboard - Chessboards don't talk! Your chessboard shouldn't be handling communications at all!



**Single Responsibility Principle**: "A class should have only one reason to change"

Game state and communication are the reasons! Chessboard shouldn't worry about both. 

Better: the chessboard should provide an interface for checking/mutating its state via parameters/returns/exceptions when necessary. Confine the actual user interface outside of the chessboard class.



Question:  Should `main.cc` handle all communication, and then call the related chessboard methods?

No, hard to reuse code in main. We should make a class distinct from the game class whose job is to handle communication.



Now, introducing...[drunroll]



## Architecture: Model-View-Controller (MCV)

In MVC, the program state, presentation logic, and control logic are all separated.

Separate the distinct notions of the data (aka the state "Model"), the presentation of the data ("view"), and the control or manipulation of data ("Controller"). 

The *Model*:

- manages application data and its modification (doesn't know anything about how the data is presented to the user)

- can have multiple view (text and graphics)

- doesn't need to know about their details
- can be implemented via observer pattern
  - We would have a link between view and model, or can communicate through the controller

The *Controller*:

- Mediates control flow between model and view
- may encapsulate turn taking or even full game rules (trade off with model)
- may communicate with user for input (or could be in the view)

The *View*:

- Manages the interface to present data. It decides how the data from the model should be presented to the user according to the capabilities of the device (e.g., a graphical interface, a text-based interface, a conversational interface, etc.)

By decoupling, presentation and control MVC promotes reuse.

<img src="https://github.com/kila097/CS246_Notes/tree/main/images/10-1.png" alt="10-1" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The Model and View in MVC are a classic implementation of the Observer design pattern, where the Model is the subject and the View is the observer. 



Example:

In chess game, we could display a graphical representation of the board, the player would drag a piece to make a move.

1. the view would have some method that responds to a mouse drag. This method would delegate handling the player action to the Controller.

   ```cpp
   void ChessView::handleMouseDrag(Point start, Point end) {
       controller->handleMouseDrag(start, end);
   }
   ```

2. the controller should translate the user interface event to game model event. So, the controller should identify what piece was dragged into what board position. Then, ask the model to handle this game action.

   ```cpp
   void ChessController::handleMouseDrag(Point start, Point end) {
       Piece piece = findPiece(start);
       Position position = findBoardPosition(end);
       model->movePieceTo(piece, position);
   }
   ```

3. the model contains the logic to handle the game action, first, it must validate if the move is a valid one. If it is, then the move should be executed by updating the state. Finally, the views(observers) are notified of the change.

   ```cpp
   void ChessModel::movePieceTo(Piece piece, Position position) {
       if (isValidMove(piece, position)) {
           // update the state of the internal fields to put the piece in the new
           // position; check other consequences of the new piece position,
           // e.g., if the player won the game, captured an enemy piece, etc.
           notifyView();
       }
   }
   
   void ChessModel::notifyViews() {
       // subject implementation of the observer design pattern
       for (int i = 0; i < view.size(); i++) {
           views.at[i].update();
       }
   }
   ```

4. Each view has a concrete implementation of the update method (observer design pattern), which should display the new state of the game board.

      ```cpp
      void ChessView::update() {
          // read the updated state from the model and
          // redraw the game board in the user interface
      }
      ```


Some of the benefits of this approach are increasing cohesion (as each class has only one responsibility), decreasing coupling (as each class communicates with the other just via a pubic interface), and making reuse easier.





## Exception Safety

Consider:

```cpp
void f() {
    myClass mc;
    myClass *p = new myClass;
    g();
    delete p;
    // does this function have memory leak?
    // under normal circumstances: no memory is leaksed, p is deleted on the last line of function
    // mc is stack-allocated, so the destructl will automatically run during stack unwinding after the end of f's execution
    // but what happens if g throws an exception...
}
```

If g throws an exception, what is guaranteed?

During stack unwinding, all stack allocated data is deallocated: destructor run, memory is reclaimed (so `mc` will still be deleted)

But pointers to heap allocated memory are not freed. (the last line od function will not execute, so p is leaked)

Therefore, if g throws, p is leaked, mc is not.

We could try adding an **exception handler**:

```cpp
void f() {
    myClass mc;
    myClass *p = new myClass;
    try {
        g();
    } catch (...) {
        delete p;
        throw;	// rethrow the exception to continue stack unwinding
    }
    delete p;
    // this is ugly! repeated code.
    // Furthermore, do we want to wrap every potential error throwing code in this?
    // No!
}
```

What we want is: here's some code that will run no matter how this function exists (normally or by exception). *We want to guarantee that something (here, delete p;) will happen*.

In some languages, a "finally" clause exists to do this. But we just said, what c++ promises, and it didn't say anything about a final clause. It did, however; say something about code that's guaranteed to run with an exception is thrown: **only destructors of stack allocated data are guaranteed to run.**



C++ idiom: **RAII - Resource Acquisition Is Initialization**

Resources should never be acquired except through the initialization of an object whose job it is to maintain that resource. E.g., we work with files without knowing what a file pointer is.

It guarantees that resouces will be freed at the end of the function.



## RAII and Smart Pointers (March 29)

Recall:

consider:

```cpp
void f() {
    MyClass mc;
    MyClass *p = new MyClass;
    g();
    delete p;
}

```

Leaks p if g throws an exception!

Could wrap all potentially error throwing code in 

```cpp
try { ... } catch { delete p; }
```

But! this is error prone and ugly, lots of repeated code. C++ promises if an exception is thrown, the stack is unwund, and destructors of stack-allocated objects will run... so ... 

**RAII** - **resource acquisition is initialization**.

Resources should only be obtained via the initialization of objects whose job it is to manage them.

Example: files

```cpp
{
    ifstream f{"myfile.txt"}
    ...
} // file is closed
```

Acquiring the recourse (file pointer) occurred by initializing the object f.

The file is guaranteed to be released  (closed) when f is popped from the stack (f's destructor runs) (when f is out of scope).



Now consider:

```cpp
MyClass *f() {
    MyClass mc;
    MyClass *p = new MyClass;
    ... // mutate object p points at
    g();
    return p;
}
```

This can be doen with dynamic memory:

```cpp
#include <memory>
class std::unique_ptr<T> 
```

`class std::unique_ptr<T>` is a class that holdes a `T *` which you supply in the constructor.



```cpp
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p { new MyClass };
// still calling new! prefer we never call new at all!
```



```cpp
MyClass *x = new MyClass;
unique_ptr<MyClass> p1{x};
unique_ptr<MyClass> p2{x};
// prefer we never call new at all! above is not RAII
```

unique_ptr means this is the only one pointer to the object. When we are trying to delete the pointer, there will be a double delete.

Prefer we never use `new` at all.



Even better:

```cpp
unique_ptr<MyClass> p = make_unique<MyClass>();
```

`std::make_unique<T>` is a function which takes as its parameters the constructor paramaters for type T.

Returns a `unique_ptr`, it is the one that calls new.



Example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
    ...
  public:
    MyClass(int x, int y) ... ;	// here1
    MyClass(int *p) ... ;		// here2
    
};


// here1: 
auto p = make_unique<MyClass>(3, 5);

// here2:
int x;
auto p = make_unique<MyClass>(&x);
// use p normally as pointers
```



Now, let's talk about the **difficulty**: does it make sense to copy something that is unique?

we say **move**, not copy, because unique things are not meant to be copied.

```cpp
unique_ptr<C> p { new C(...) }

unique_ptr<C> q = p; // compile error!
```

`unique_ptr`s are **unique**! i.e. canNOT be copied!

They can only be **moved**.



Sample implementation:

```cpp
// basicimpl.cc

#include <utility>
#include <iostream>

// explicitly disallowing the compiler for providing a default implementation for this:
unique_ptr(const unique_prt<T> &other) = delete;
unique_ptr<T> &operator=(const unique_ptr<T> &other) = delete;
```

We can tell compiler not to use built in copy construct and copy assignment operator by using `= delete;`, after function.



Example: things we CANNOT do:

```cpp
void f() {
    int *p = new int{5};
	unique_ptr<int> p1{p};
	unique_ptr<int> p2{p};	// create two unique pointers for the same integer
}	// p1, p2 out of scope

// BAD! This results in double free!
```

When p1 is out of scope, its destructor runs. Then when p2 is out of scope, its destructor also runs, destroying the memory that has been already destroyed by p1. Hence double free! Make sure you never do this.



### Copying pointers

What if you need to be able to copy pointers?

The first question you need to answer is: *Who owns it*?

- Who will own the resource? Who has the responsibility of freeing it?

- Other pointer should be a unique_ptr. all others can be raw pointers

- can fetch the raw pointer with `std::unique_ptr<T>::get()` // a raw pointer who doesn't have the ownership of the unique pointer but stores it

- ```cpp
  std::unique_ptr<Cell> p{...};
  s.attach(p.get());
  ```



If there is true ownership, i.e. any of several pointers might need to free the resource -- the last one that is being deleted destructs the object.

- use `std::share_ptr<T>`, which also have `make_share<T> (...);`

```cpp
{ 
    auto p1 = make_share<MyClass>();	// allocates space for MyClass
    if (...) {
        auto p2 = p1; // two pointers point at the same object
    }	// p2 goes out of scope, the object is not deleted (because p1 still exists and points at that memory)
}	// here, p1 is popped, and the object is deleted
```



Q: How do destructor know when to delete. and when to not delete?

A: Have a count of the shared pointers:



Shared_ptrs maintain **a reference count** - a count of all shared_ptrs pointing at the same object. 

The memory is freed when the number of shared_ptrs pointing at it reaches 0.

Use the type of ptr that accurately reflects the ptrs ownership role: Dramatically fewer opportunities for leaks.



### More about Smart Pointers

(These are not included in the lecture, but previous from course notes)

Why is it hard to manage memory?

- You have two options for storing something: **heap** or **stack**. Local variables allocate their space on the stack, and to use heap storage, instead put a pointer on stack, and use `new` and `delete` to allocate and reclaim its space.
- the problem with stack-based storage: it's too limiting in object lifetime: all stack-allocated values are destroyed when the relevant function returns, all object must exist for exactly the duration of the function that declares them.
- heap-allocated values do not have this restriction, but they are difficult to corretly manage, control flow can be extremely complicated.



The C++ STL offers two wrapper classes for pointers, which gives greater flexibility than stack storage, handle most lifetimes for objects, as well as providing protection to assure that those lifetimes are correctly implementated.



#### `unique_ptr`

A `unique_ptr` wraps a pointer, and it is guarantted to be the only pointer to the heap-allocated object.

Since this `unique_ptr` is unique, its own destructor can delete the object pointer to. The pointed-to object is deleted when its `unique_ptr` goes out of scope.

Note that the automatic type of p is `unique_ptr<Class>`

**unique_ptrs enforce their uniqueness. Thus, a unique_ptr cannot be copied; to do so would make it non-unique. Since unique_ptrs cannot be copied, they cannot be passed by value**

We must instead **move** it.

To move a `unique_ptr` is to transfer the actual, underlying pointer to another `unique_ptr`, and remove it from its starting `unique_ptr`.

In this way, the "ownership" of the object may change, if we were to attempt to use p after the move, it would no longer be available:

```cpp
#include <memory>
class Point {
  public:
    Point(double sx, double sy) : x{sx}, y{sy} {}
    double x, y;
};

double pointDistance(std::unique_ptr<Point>);

double myDistance(double x, double y) {
    auto p = std::make_unique<Point>(x, y);
    // here, we could access p->x and p->y, just as if p was a pointer
    double ret = pointDistance(std::move(p));
    ret += p->x; // segmentation fault!
    return ret;
}
```

In this way, unique_ptrs have a restricted lifetime, like stack values, but with much more control. The object is deleted when unique_ptr goes out of scope, like stack-allocated values, and we do not need to worry about explicitly deleting the object, or tracking all of the particular paths through the program, including exceptions, that may need to be handled to make sure deletion occurs.

But, because we can move a unique_ptr and transfer the ownership and extend (or contract) the lifetime, our values may have arbitraily long lifetime, like heap-allocated values.



Though unique_ptrs cannot be passed by value (because they cannot be copied), they can safely be passed by *reference*. But it is not common to do this. The `get` method of `unique_ptrs` gets the underlying pointer, but it is still considered owned by the unique_ptr. That is, when the unique_ptr goes out of scope, the object will be deleted, even if you have extracted the pointer with `get`.

Usage:

```cpp
double pointDistance(Point *);

double myDistance(double x, double y) {
    auto p = make_unique<Point>(x, y);
    return pointDistance(p.get());
}
```

Be careful when to use get to assure that the underlying pointer is not retained after the unique_ptr has gone out of scope.

Consider the owndership when considering whether to use unique_ptrs:

- if the pointer has a unique owner, use unique_ptr
- if there is no single owner, you need something more sophisticated: the shared_ptr







#### `shared_ptr`

shared_ptr is a pointer that is shared, and it controls the lifetime of the object it points to. Unlike a unique_ptr, you may have multiple shared_ptr pointing to the same object.

shared_ptr can be copied and passed by value, exactly like normal * pointers, but don't need to be explicitly deleted.

How is this possible? shared_ptrs used a technique called **reference counting** to determine when there are not more shared_ptrs pointing to a given object. When you copy a shared_ptr, it increases an internal *reference count* by 1. When a shared_ptr goes out of scope, the internal reference count is reduced by 1. When it reaches 0, it is deleted.

All of this reference count is handled automatically in the constructor, copy constructor, and destructor for shared_ptr itself. So usually, all a programmer needs to do is use shared_ptr instead of raw pointers.



Improving the above example using shared_ptrs:

```cpp
double pointDistance(std::shared_ptr<Point>);

double myDistance(double x, double y) {
    auto p = std::make_share<Point>(x, y);
    return pointDistance(p);
}
```

p does not need to be removed, but can simply be shared, so p remains usable:

```cpp
double myDistance(double x, double y) {
    auto p = std::make_share<Point>(x, y);
    double ret = pointDistance(p);
    ret += p->x; // no problem here
    return ret;
}
```



The summarized example:

```cpp
double pointDistance(std::shared_ptr<Point> p2) {
    return sqrt(p2->x*p2->x + p2->y*p2->y);
}

double mydistance(double x, double y) {
    auto p = std::make_shared<Point>(x, y); // p's reference count is 1
    double ret = pointDistance(p); // During pointDistance, p's reference count is 2
    // As soon as pointDistance ends, p's reference count is reduced to 1 again
    ret += p->x;
    return ret; // After returning, p's reference count is reduced to 0, so the Point is deleted
}
```



```cpp
std::shared_ptr<Point> lastPoint;

double pointDistance(std::shared_ptr<Point> p2) {
    // Calling this function increases p2's reference count by 1
    double dx = p2->x - lastPoint->x,
           dy = p2->y - lastPoint->y;
    double ret = sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);

    /* This assignment increases p2's reference count by 1, but also decreases
     * the reference count of the previous object pointed to by lastPoint. If
     * the prevoius reference count was reduced to 0, then the previous
     * lastPoint would additionally be deleted. */
    lastPoint = p2;

    return ret; // Returning reduces p2's reference count by 1, but the increase from lastPoint remains
}

double mydistance(double x, double y) {
    auto p = std::make_shared<Point>(x, y); // p's reference count is 1

    /* Calling pointDistance increases p's reference count to 2 by copying it
     * to p2. pointDistance then increases it to 3, by copying it to lastPoint. */
    double ret = pointDistance(p);
    /* When pointDistance returns, p's reference count is reduced to 2, because
     * p2 goes out of scope. */

    return ret;
    /* When this function returns, p's reference count is reduced to 1, so it
     * is not deleted. It is still referenced by lastPoint. Its reference count
     * only reaches 0 when lastPoint is replaced, and at that point, it is
     * deleted. */
}
```



##### Caveats of `shared_ptrs`

shared_ptrs come with important caveats that must be understood.

Consider the implementation of a graph:

```cpp
class GraphNode {
    string name;
    vector<stared_ptr<GraphNode>> vertices;
    
  public:
    GraphNode(sname) : name(sname) {}
    
    void addVertex(shared_ptr<GraphNode> to) {
        vertices.push_back(to);
    }
}
```

This seems like a fine way of storying graph nodes and vertices, but in many real example, it will leak memory, failing to delete the graph nodes.

Why? consider this example:

```cpp
void graphWork() {
    auto root = make_shared<GraphNode>("Node 1");
    auto n2 = make_shared<GraphNode>("Node 2");
    root->addVertex(n2);
    ... // some graph work
    return;
}
```

Adding the vertex from root to n2 increases n2's reference count to 2, because it now has the additional reference from root's vertices, similarly, is also increases root's reference count to 2.

Returning from graphWork reduces each of them by 1, because the root and n2 variables have gone out of scopt. But, 2 - 1 = 1, so these two objects are *never* deleted, and their memory is leaked.

This problem is called **cylic reference**, and is a fundamental flaw in the reference counting technique. 

The only solutions to it are:

1. reorganize your data so that no such cycles exists
2. not to use reference counting (shared_ptrs) at all

Usually, complex data structures like this are implemented with normal * pointers, and controlled manually.



The second major caveat with shared_ptrs is that counting reference is extra work, and thus a *performance penalty*.



Like unique_ptrs, the shared_ptrs have a `get` method, allowing you to get the underlying pointer. This underlying pointer is unprotected, and you can only guarantee that it isn't deleted by making sure you retain a shared_ptr for at least as long as the * pointer.

shared_ptrs also have a use_count method, which returns the reference count. This is occasionally useful for debugging, otherwise it should never be used.



#### Summary

Both unique_ptrs and shared_ptrs are so-called **smart pointers**. 

Many other programming languages, such as Racket, use a technique called **garbage collection** to get rid of the need for explicit memory management at all, but at a performance cost similar to (but usually better than) shared_ptrs. However, garbage collection is infeasible for C++.





## Exception Safety Continued (March 29)

Back to exception safety:
There are 3 levels of excaption safety for a function

1. **Basic Guarantee** - if an exception occurs during this function, the program will be in some valid, *unspecified* state. "valid" means mothing is leaked and Class invariants are maintained
2. **Strong Guarantee** - if f throws or propagates an exception, the state of the program will be as it was before f was called
3. **No-throw Guarantee** - f will never throw an exception and will always complete task



Example:

```cpp
class A { ... }
class B { ... }
class C {
    A a;
    B b;
  public:
    void f() {
        a.g(); // A::g offers strong guarantee
        b.h(); // B::h offers strong guarantee
    }
};
```

If `a.g()` throws, nothing is happened, so that is ok.

If `a.g()` succeeds, and `b.h() `throws, the effects of `a.g()` must be *undone* to offer the *strong guarantee*. That is very hard, or impossible, if `a.g()` has non-local side effects (e.g. mutating a global variable, or static variable, or printing things/generates output). The state has changed in an irreversible way.

So no not exception safe, basic guarantee at best, no guarantee if calling `a.h()` without `b.h()` violates class C's invariants.



If `A::g  `and `B::g` have no non-local side effects. We can fix this using an old idiom: **copy and swap**.

```cpp
class C{
    A a;
    B b;
  public:
    void f() {
        A atemp = a;
        B btemp = b;
        atemp f();
        btemp y();
        // if either of these throws, the originals are still in tact
        a = atemp;
        b = btemp;	//
        
	}
};
```

Because copy assignment operator could throw, we don't have exception safety yet. (if `b = btemp;` throws , `a` has already been modified). It would be better if we could guarantee the "swap" put was a *no-throw* operation. A non-throwing swap is at the heart of exception safety in C++.



Observation: Copying pointers never throws

```cpp
class C {
    // solution: use the pimpl idiom
    unique_ptr<CImpl> pImpl;
    void f() {
        auto temp = make_unique<CImpl>(*pImpl); // just dereference the unique ptr and make a new one.
        temp->a.g();
        temp->b.h();
        std::swap(pImpl, temp);	// no-throw
    }
};
```

Now exception safe. If `A::g` does not have non-local side effects.



// after we done all of this, f offers the strong guarantee.





## March 31

Exception safety and STL vectors:

vectors:

- encapsulates a heap-allocated array
- follow RAII - when a stack-allocated vector goes out of scope, the internal heap allocated array is freed (doesn't mean all members of the array is freed, but the array itself is freed) (you can use unique ptr or shared ptr to solve this problem)

```cpp
void f() {
    vector<MyClass> v;
    ...
} // here, v goes out of scope, array is freed, MyClass objects all are destroyed, so their destructors run
```

BUT,

```cpp
void g() {
    vector<MyClass*> v;
    ...
    v.emplace_back(new MyClass{...});
    ...
} // v goes out of scope, array of pointers is freed, but pointers don't have destructors, MyClass objects are leaked
```

So, you have to free them manually, e.g.

```cpp
for (auto &p :v) delete p;
```

Or, don't use raw pointers, and use smart pointers

```cpp
void h() {
    vector<unique_ptr<MyClass>> v;
    ...
} // if v goes out of scope, array is freed, unique_ptr objects are in the array, so they are destroyed, their destructors run, their destructors delete the MyClass objects
```



Consider now the method `vector<T>::emplace_back`

- offers the strong guarantee
- if the array is full (i.e., if size == cap(acity))
  - allocate a new larger array
  - copy objects over (copy ctor)
    - if a copy ctor throws
      - destroy the new array,
      - the old array still in tact
    - if it doesn't throw
      - delete the old array



But, copying is expensive, and if successful, the old data will be thrown away. 

Wouldn't <u>moving</u> from the old array to the new array be more efficient?



- Allocate new larger array
- move objects over
- delete old array

The problem: if the move constructor throws, then `emplace_back` can't offer the strong guarantee because old array no longer intact. But `emplace_back` does offer it.

Therefore, if the move ctor offers the *no-throw* guarantee, `emplace_back` will move objects. Otherwise, it will use the copy ctor, which may be slower.

So, your *move* operation should provide the *no-throw* guarantee, if possible, and you should indicate that they do.

```cpp
class MyClass {
  public:
    MyClass( MyClass &&other ) noexcept {...}; // noexcept tells compiler that the function does not throw
    MyClass &operator( MyClass &&other ) noexcept {...};
};
```

In general, if you follow the **pImpl idiom**, writing non-throwing moves and swaps is trivial.

If you know a function will never throw or propagate an exception, declare it as `noexcept`. This facilitates optimization. At a minimum, *moves* and *swaps* should be `noexcept`.
