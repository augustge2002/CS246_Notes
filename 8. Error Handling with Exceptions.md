# 8. Error Handling with Exceptions

## Introduction to Exceptions (March 10)

RECALL our vectors code:

```cpp
v[i]; // unchecked
v.at(i); // checked, but what should happen when out of bound?
```

Vectors code can detect the error, but it doesn't know about it. Client can respond but can't detect the error. Error recovery is a non-local problem.



**Problem**: What should happen when using v.at(i) when i is out of bound?

**C Solution**:

- some functions that might fail return a status code or set the global variable error
- leads to awkward programming, the awkward programing encourages programmers to ignore error checks



**C++ Solution**:

- when an error conditions arises, the function **raises** (or **throws**) an **exception**
- Then what happens? By default, execution stops (if nothing else is done).
- we can write **handlers** to **catch** exceptions and deal with them.



vector<T>::at rises the exception std::out_of_range when it fails. We can handle it like so:

```cpp
#include <stdexcept>
...
try {
    cout << v.at(1000) << endl;	// statements that may raise an exception
} catch (out_of_range r) {	// r is the exception and std::out_of_range is the type
    // specify what to do if it fails
    cerr << "Range Error" << r.what() << endl;	// r.what() is a description
}
```





### Throwing and Handling Exception

From course notes Spring 2021.

Consider the Student class, you are writing the helper function `checkGrade`, which should report an error if the submitted grade is lower than zero or higher than 100:

```cpp
// helper function
int checkGrade( int grade ) {
    if (grade >= 0 && grade <= 100) {
        return grade;
    } else {
        // How should we report this error?
    }
}


class Student {
    const int id;
    int assns, mt, final;
  public:
    Student(const int id, int assns = 0, int mt = 0, int final = 0)
        	: id{id}, assns{assns}, mt{checkGrade(mt)}, final{checkGrade(final)} {}
    float grade() const {
        return assns * 0.4 + mt * 0.2 + final * 0.4;
    }
};

```



```cpp
// main.cc

int main() {
    // How would we detect here if these grades are valid?
    Student s{7899, -10, 50, 150};
    cout << "s.grade() = " << s.grade() << endl;
}
```

What should happen when the function checkGrade detects an invalid grade?



The function **raises**/**throws** an **exception**, and we write **handlers** to **catch** exceptions and deal with them.

In C++, we can throw anything, but the usual practice is to define specific exception classes. This makes exception handling easier because the client can catch specific exception classes.

```cpp
class InvalidGrade {
    // we will add fields later
};

// helper function
int checkGrade( int grade ) {
    if (grade >= 0 && grade <= 100) {
        return grade;
    } else {
        throw InvalidGrade{};
    }
}
```

To handle exceptions, we use a *try-catch* block.

```cpp
// in main.cc
int main() {
    try {
        Student s{7899, -10, 50, 150};
        cout << "s.grade() = " << s.grade() << endl;
    } catch (InvalidGrade) {
        cout << "Invalid grade." << endl;
    }
}
```

All the statements that go within the `try{ }` block are *protected*, meaning that if an exception is raised while executing any of them, the execution will move to catch blocks.

In a catch block, we specify the type of exception that we want to handle. In this case, objects of the InvalidGrade class.

If an exception of this type is raised, the statements within the `catch{ }` block are executed.

After that, the program's execution continues on the next line after the catch block. If an exception of any other type is raised, the catch block won't be executed and the program will terminate immediately just as if we did not have any try-catch.

Thus, *if you don't have a catch block that matches the type of the raised exception, it's just like not having any catch block at all*.



It would be better if we could pass additional information in the exception, which could be displayed in the error message. As the exception is just an object, we can add fields to the class, which we can populate with information about the error before throwing the exception.

```cpp
class InvalidGrade {
    int grade;
  public:
	InvalidGrade(grade) : grade{grade} {}
    int getGrade() const { return grade; }
};

// helper function
int checkGrade( int grade ) {
    if (grade >= 0 && grade <= 100) {
        return grade;
    } else {
        throw InvalidGrade{grade};
    }
}
```

Update our exception handler by catching the thrown object into the variable ex, then we can read the information in the object to include it into our error message:

```cpp
// in main.cc
int main() {
    try {
        Student s{7899, -10, 50, 150};
        cout << "s.grade() = " << s.grade() << endl;
    } catch (InvalidGrade ex) {
        cout << "Invalid grade: " << ex.getGrade() << endl;
    }
}
```



Exceptions can be any complex object, so there is no limit on the amount of information that you can include on the object. For performance optimization, it is recommended to pass just the necessary information. However, programmers often use the attributes of the exception to provide enough detail about it, which the program can use to recover from the exception and continue its execution, or to display an appropriate message to the user.



A great benefit of programming with exceptions is that once you catch an exception, the program does not terminate. Execution continues right after the catch block.

Example: in a loop

```cpp
int main() {
    Student s;
    while (true) {
        try {
            // assume that we have a method to read a Student object from cin, which may throw an InvalidGrade exception
            cin >> s;
            cout << "s.grade() = " << s.grade() << endl;
        } catch (InvalidGrade ex) {
            cout << "Invalid grade: " << ex.getGrade() << endl;
        }
        // write some condition to break the while loop
    }
}
```



## Exceptions and the Call Chain (March 10)



What happens when an exception is raised in a call chain?

```cpp
void f() {
    throw out_of_range{"f"}; // this "f" here is the what()
    // raises an exception, "f" will be returned by .what()
}

void g() { f(); }
void h() { g(); }


int main() {
    try {
        h();
    } catch (out_of_range r) {...}
}
```

So main calls h, h calls g, and g calls f, then f throws (out_of_range). Control goes back through the call chain (unwinding the stack) until a handler is found. If a function "foo" doesn't catch an exception that was thrown by a function it called, then foo propagates that exception. If there is no matching handler in the entire call chain then the program terminates. 

`out_of_range` is a class. The statement `throw out_of_range{"f"}` calls out_of_range's constructor with argument `"f"` (the info for `.what()`). 



```cpp
void f() {
    vector<int> x{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *p = new int[100];
    try { ... }
    catch (someError s) {
        throw someError{ ... };
    }
    delete []p;
}
// memory leak with p, but not x
```



## Partial Exception Handling

A handler can do part of the recovery job (i.e. execute some corrective code, and throw another exception):

```cpp
try { ... }
catch (someErrorType s) {
    throw someOtherError{...};
}
```

we can do `throw;` instead of `throw s;` to **rethrow** the exact same error received (maintaining its static type)

`throw s;` throws the copy which may be sliced even if we catch by reference

```cpp
try {...}
catch (SomeErrorType s) {
    ...
    throw;
}
```

This is useful when a function needs to do some cleanup, but it won't be able to completely handle the error.

For example, if a function allocated dynamic memory, a **partial exception** handler can free it before rethrowing the original exception. Therefore, the function avoids a memory leak but lets someone else handle the exception.

```cpp
void f() {
  throw out_of_range{"f"};
}
void g() {
  f();
}

//// modify this //////////////
void h() {
    cout << "Start h" <, endl;
   	try {
        g();
    } catch (out_of_range) {
        cer << "Range error in h()" << endl;
        throw;
    }
    cout << "Finish h" << endl;
}

/////////////////////////////

int main() {
  try {
    h();
  }
  catch (out_of_range) {
    cerr << "Range error in main()" << endl;
  }
}

```



Generally define your own meaningful error classes to throw exceptions

```cpp
class BadInput {
    int n;
}
```



Catching exceptions by reference prevents slicing when catching a base class, which in theory could have virtual methods. So if we slice and force a base class object we might lose info specialized behaviour. Catching by reference is usually the *right* thing to do.

***â€œThrow by value, catch by reference."***



**Warning**: NEVER let a destructor throw! By default, a program will terminate immediately because the destructor is implicitly noexcept. If you turn this off and allow destructor to throw, the program will terminate if there are two unhandled exceptions - which might occur during unwinding of a stack from another exception.

If the destructor is being executed during stack unwinding while dealing with another exception, you now have *two* active, unhandled exceptions and the program *will* abort immediately (by calling `std::terminate`).





## March 15

RECALL:

```cpp
try {...}
catch (someErrorType s) {
    // do your error recovery
    throw someOtherError{};		// there is still an error that need to be dealt with
}
```

OR, you can throw the same exception

```cpp
try {...}
catch (someErrorType s) {
    throw;	// just say throw, and it is the same exception
}
```



```cpp
// exn.cc
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class SomeErrorType {};
class SpecialErrorType : public SomeErrorType {};

void foo() {
  throw SpecialErrorType{};
}

void bar() {
  try {
    foo();	// throws SpecialErrorType, which is a SomeErrorType
  } catch (SomeErrorType s) {
    // code for bar's portion of error recovery
    throw s;
  }
}

int main() {
  try {
    bar();
  } catch (SpecialErrorType s) {
    cout << "Caught Special Error Type" << endl;
  } catch (...) {	// ... is the syntax for "catch any exception"
    cout << "Caught something" << endl;
  }
}
```

`catch (...)` catches any exception

Here we say `throw s;`, and the output is 

```
Caught something
```

If we say `throw;`, we get the output

```
Caught Special Error Type
```



Why do we say `throw;` rather than `throw s;`?

Because the exception might actually belong to a subclass of the error type we caught (in this case, SpecialErrorType and SomeErrorType).

`throw;` rethrows the exact error received (even maintaining its static type) whereas `throw s;` throws the copy which may be sliced. Even if we catch by reference (no slicing), `throw s;`, the static type is whatever `s` is (e.g. SomeErrorType & vs. SpecialErrorType)



A handler can also be a ***catch-all***.

```cpp
try {...}
catch (...) {	// <= literally mean ',,,'
    // ,,, <= figuratively mean ...
}
```



You can throw anything you want, doesn't have to be an object (preferably is a meaningful error object).

Let's write a very silly program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void fact(int n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        throw 1;
    }
    try { fact(n - 1); }
    catch (int x) {
        throw x * n;
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        fact(5);
    } catch (int n) {
        cout << "fact(5) = " << n << endl;
    }
}

```



Write a Fibonacci sequence:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void fib(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) throw 1;
    try {
        fib(n - 1);
    } catch (int fnm1) {
        try {
            fib(n-2);
        } catch (int fnm2) {
            throw fnm1 + fnm2;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        fib(30);
    } catch (int fib) {
        cout << fib << endl;
    }
}
```

Do not throw exceptions with control flows! What we did is silly.



Generally, define your own meaningful error classes to throw as exceptions.

```cpp
class BadInput {};

try {
    int n;
    if (!cin >> n) throw BadInput{};
} catch (BadInput &) {
    cerr << "Input not well formed" << endl;
}
```



Catching exceptions by reference prevents **slicing** when catching a base class. Which in theory, could also have virtual methods. So if we slice and force into a base class object, we might lose information/specialized behaviour. Catching by reference is usually the correct thing to do. 

The maxim in C++ is: ***"Throw by value, catch by reference"***



**WARNING**: <u>**NEVER**</u> let a destructor throw an exception! By default, a program will terminate immediately because the dtor is implicitly *noexcept*. If you turn this off and allow your dtor to throw, the program will immediately terminate if there are two unhandled exceptions. If a destructor throws, this might occur during the unwinding of the stack from another exception.
